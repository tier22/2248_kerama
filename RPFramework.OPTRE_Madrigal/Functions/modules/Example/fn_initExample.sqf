Additional Information:
This is the example additional module.
This mainly gives an idea how you can structure your module and what kind of things modules can currently do in RPF.

Read the readme file for full documentation on modules.

Currently this file doesn't contain any code, but it's good to have even an empty init function just so that adding your module to the framework is streamlined.
